**Data Cleaning and Merging**

To begin, I merged 64 datasets provided for this hackathon into a single clean dataset. 
This process involved:

-Ensuring compatibility between files with different encodings.
-Removing any inconsistencies or missing values.
-Standardizing the format of the datasets to create a cohesive structure for analysis.

**Data Aggregation and Analysis**
-I performed various pandas operations and aggregations to derive meaningful conclusions from the data. 
-This helped in uncovering patterns and trends that were essential for further analysis and model building.

**Visualization**
-To provide a clear view of the trends, I used Matplotlib to generate line plots. 
-These visualizations were crucial for identifying relationships and insights from the data, such as changes over time or across categories.

**Example:**

A line plot was created to showcase to understand whether the rent of a property was dependent more on its  age or size, helping to identify key changes and patterns across the dataset.
